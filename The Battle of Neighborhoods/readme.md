# The Battle of Neighborhoods

```NYC and London are the two most important metro cities and the financial centers of their respective country in the world. So, there is a competition among the cities as in which city is the most perfect city. Also the tourism sector of both these citiesâ€™ is very strong. There has been a war for supremacy in terms of quality of life, jobs, education, entertainment and recreational facilities that these cities have to offer to its residents and also for the tourists.```

```The deciding factor for most would be on how lively, supportive, vibrant and unique each of the cities can be when compared to each other. This project attempts to analyze the neighborhoods in each of these two cities (London and NYC) and tries to understand what is popular in them and what they have to offer to someone who is contemplating to make a choice on visiting or seeking a life in either of these metro cities.```

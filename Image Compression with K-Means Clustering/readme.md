<h1 align='center'> Image Compression with K-Means Clustering</h1>
<h4 align='center'>- Chirag Sable</h4><br>

In this project, we will apply the k-means clustering unsupervised learning algorithm using scikit-learn and Python to build an image compression application with interactive controls.

Here, we will also learn about pre-processing high-resolution image data for k-means clustering, conducting basic exploratory data analysis (EDA) and data visualization, applying a computationally time-efficient implementation of the k-means algorithm, Mini-Batch K-Means, to compress images, and leverage the Jupyter widgets library to build interactive GUI components to select images from a drop-down list and pick values of k using a slider.

Following python modules/functions have been used in the project:-
1. `matplotlib` for plots and charts visualization of the outcomes.
2. `Pandas` for storing and manipulating data.
3. `Numpy` for its use in data-manipulation.
4. `sklearn` functionalities like `Kmeans`.
5. `skimage` for dealing with images.
6. `ipywidgets` for interactive widgets.

<h2>The Project has been divided into 5-tasks:- </h2>

1. Importing Libraries
2. Data Preprocessing
3. Visualizing the Color Space using Point Clouds
4. Visualizing the K-Means Reduced Color Space
5. K-means Image Compression with Interactive Controls

<h1 align='center'> Classification with Python</h1>
<h4 align='center'>- Chirag Sable</h4><br>

In this mini project we will use few classification algorithms on a Loan dataset.

We load the dataset using Pandas library, and apply the classification algorithms, and find the best one for this specific dataset by accuracy evaluation methods. The dataset can be downloaded from [here](!wget -O loan_train.csv https://s3-api.us-geo.objectstorage.softlayer.net/cf-courses-data/CognitiveClass/ML0101ENv3/labs/loan_train.csv).

The classification algorithms used in this project are:
1. K Nearest Neighbor(KNN)
2. Decision Tree
3. Support Vector Machine
4. Logistic Regression

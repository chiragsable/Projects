<h1 align='center'> Segementing and Clustering Neighborhoods in Toronto, Canada</h1>
<h4 align='center'>- Chirag Sable</h4><br>

In this project, we will explore, segment, and cluster the neighborhoods in the city of Toronto. However, the neighborhood data is not readily available on the internet.

For the Toronto neighborhood data, a [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_postal_codes_of_Canada:_M) exists that has all the information we need to explore and cluster the neighborhoods in Toronto. But since the data is to be taken from a webpage it is obvious that the data will not be clean. So, initially, will be required to scrape the Wikipedia page and wrangle the data, clean it, and then read it into a pandas dataframe so that it is in a structured format.

Once the data is in a structured format, we can start the analysis to explore and cluster the neighborhoods in the city of Toronto. The dataframe from the Wikipedia page will have three columns namely Postal Code, Borough and Neighborhood.
